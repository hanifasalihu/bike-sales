▪ Strategy should be put in place to encourage buyers from the younger age group and older age group to increase sales in these groups.
▪ Rewards and Loyalty program ideas should be introduced so this can encourage existing customer to continue patronage (like aftercare services).
▪ More customers are looking for businesses that focus on sustainability, like reducing carbon footprint.

### Limitations

▪ Insufficient online presence may result in opportunities missed for reaching a more customers.
▪ There is a limited choices of products for the range of customers, e.g. seniors age group barely patronize the store.
▪ The non-availability of demand in certain regions could be caused by weather changes in these areas.

### Conclusion

▪ This project created a comprehensive sales analysis dashboard using the provided dataset.
▪ Through various perspectives, the dashboard will allow users to gain valuable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends.
